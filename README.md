# Idle Dice Deobfuscated

The original Idle Dice game by Luts91 was translated into obfuscated code by https://obfuscator.io/. This repository aims to make the code much more readable, while making minimal changes to its functionality. 

The main app.js file was the only one affected by this, so that is the sole focus of this project.
